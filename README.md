# Spam-Mail-Detection

Email Classifier Project

Overview

This project aims to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using various machine learning models and techniques. The dataset was preprocessed to clean and prepare the data for modeling. Key steps included data preprocessing, feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW) vectorization, and addressing class imbalance.

Steps and Methodology

	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Removed special characters and punctuation from the email texts.
	•	Cleaned and standardized the text data for further processing.
	2.	Feature Extraction:
	•	Utilized CountVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical feature vectors (Bag of Words).
	•	Extracted counts of words, characters, and sentences to explore their correlations with spam or non-spam labels.
	3.	Addressing Class Imbalance:
	•	Employed the BalancedBaggingClassifier to handle the class imbalance problem effectively.
	4.	Modeling:
	•	Implemented several machine learning models:
	•	Naive Bayes classifiers
	•	Random Forest classifiers
	•	XGBoost
	•	Evaluated models based on precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
	5.	Performance Enhancement:
	•	Focus on enhancing recall for spam labels while maintaining a balanced F1 score.
	•	Tuned model parameters and experimented with different classifiers to achieve optimal performance.

Results

	•	Model Comparison:
	•	Evaluated models based on their precision, recall, and F1 score.
	•	Identified the best-performing model in terms of overall performance metrics.
	•	Enhanced Recall:
	•	Techniques and adjustments made to improve recall specifically for spam emails.
	•	Balanced the trade-off between recall and F1 score to ensure robust classification performance.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates effective techniques for email classification using machine learning, addressing challenges such as class imbalance and optimizing performance metrics like recall and F1 score. Future work could involve exploring additional feature engineering techniques or advanced modeling approaches to further improve classification accuracy.
